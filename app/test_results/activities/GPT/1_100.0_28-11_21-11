Example prompt input:
If an 'activity' is defined as 'a specific action or process that involves 
        physical or mental effort, often undertaken for enjoyment, recreation, or as a part of a routine.', 
        First provide a description of "dog" then compare this description 
        with the provided definition, then if "dog" is an activity, is_correct = True. 
        End your answer in the format: 
dict(is_correct=True/False)

Example prompt output:
dict(is_correct=False)

All model outputs and expected outputs:
{'input': "Activity(activity=dog, candidate_labels=['Yes', 'No'])", 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}
