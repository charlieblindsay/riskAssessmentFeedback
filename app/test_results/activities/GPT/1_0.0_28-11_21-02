Example prompt input:
If an 'activity' is defined as 'a specific action or process that involves 
        physical or mental effort, often undertaken for enjoyment, recreation, or as a part of a routine.', 
        First provide a description of "dog" then compare this description 
        with the provided definition, then if "dog" is an activity, is_correct = True. 
        End your answer in the format: 
dict(is_correct=True/False)

Example prompt output:
dict(is_correct=False)

All model outputs and expected outputs:
{'input': <PromptInputs.Activity object at 0x0000020FF7F53FD0>, 'is_correct': None, 'expected_output': False}


The following are the prompt outputs for incorrect responses: 
 To describe a "dog," we would typically refer to it as a domesticated mammal often kept as a pet or used for various purposes such as herding, hunting, or guarding. Dogs are known for their loyalty, companionship, and ability to be trained.

Comparing this description of a dog with the provided definition of an activity, it is clear that a "dog" does not fit the criteria. While dogs can be involved in activities or participate in certain actions (such as playing fetch or participating in dog shows), they themselves are not an activity. Dogs are living beings and cannot be classified as an activity.

Therefore, the statement "dog is an activity" is incorrect.

  "is_correct": false
