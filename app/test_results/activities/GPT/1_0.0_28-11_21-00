Example prompt input:
If an 'activity' is defined as 'a specific action or process that involves 
        physical or mental effort, often undertaken for enjoyment, recreation, or as a part of a routine.', 
        First provide a description of "dog" then compare this description 
        with the provided definition, then if "dog" is an activity, is_correct = True. 
        End your answer in the format: 
dict('input'=Activity(activity="dog"), is_correct=True/False)

Example prompt output:
dict('input'=Activity(activity="dog"), is_correct=False)

All model outputs and expected outputs:
{'input': <PromptInputs.Activity object at 0x000001ADE94709D0>, 'is_correct': None, 'expected_output': False}


The following are the prompt outputs for incorrect responses: 
 dict('input'=Activity(activity="dog"), is_correct=False)
