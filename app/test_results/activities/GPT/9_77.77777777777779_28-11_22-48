Example prompt input:
The definition of activity is: 'a specific action or process that involves 
        physical or mental effort'. 
        In one sentence, provide a description of "dog". Then in one sentence 
        compare this description with the provided definition of an activity. 
        Then if "dog" is an activity, is_correct = True. 
        Then write one sentence in the format: 
dict(is_correct=True/False)

Example prompt output:
A dog is a domesticated mammal that is often kept as a pet or used for various purposes such as hunting or herding.
Comparing this description with the definition of an activity, it can be seen that a dog is not a specific action or process that involves physical or mental effort, but rather a living being.
dict(is_correct=False)

All model outputs and expected outputs:
{'input': 'Activity(activity=dog)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=Butterfly spotting)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': True}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=Climbing a mountain)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': True}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=Paris)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=table)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=cat)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=water)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=team)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=toothpaste)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}


The following are the prompt outputs for incorrect responses: 
 A dog is a domesticated mammal commonly kept as a pet or used for work or sports.
Comparing this description with the definition of an activity, a dog can be involved in physical effort and mental stimulation, making it similar to an activity.
dict(is_correct=True)

A team is a group of individuals who come together to achieve a common goal through collaboration and coordination. 
The description of a team involves the collaboration and coordination of individuals towards a common goal, which aligns with the definition of an activity as it involves physical or mental effort. Therefore, if "team" is considered an activity, is_correct = True. 
{"is_correct": True}
