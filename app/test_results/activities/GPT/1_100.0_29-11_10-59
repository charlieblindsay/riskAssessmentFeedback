Example prompt input:

        If an 'activity' is defined as 'An activity is generally defined as a specific action or process that involves 
        physical or mental effort.', 
        Firstly, in one sentence, provide a description of "dog". Secondly, in one sentence, 
        compare this description with the provided definition of an activity. Then decide if "dog" 
        is an activity. Write your final sentence in the format: 
        dict(input="dog", is_activity=True/False)

Example prompt output:
dict(input="dog", is_activity=False)

All model outputs and expected outputs:
{'input': 'Activity(activity=dog)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}
