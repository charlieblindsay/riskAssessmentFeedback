Example prompt input:
In one sentence, provide a description of "dog". Then in one sentence 
        compare this description with the definition of an activity. Then if "dog" is an activity, 
        is_correct = True. Then write one sentence in the format: 
dict(is_correct=True/False)

Example prompt output:
A dog is a domesticated mammal that is commonly kept as a pet or used for various working purposes. 

Although a dog can engage in activities, such as playing or exercising, the definition of a dog itself cannot be compared to the definition of an activity. 

dict(is_correct=False)

All model outputs and expected outputs:
{'input': 'Activity(activity=dog)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=Butterfly spotting)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': True}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=Climbing a mountain)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': True}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=Paris)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=table)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=cat)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=water)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=team)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'Activity(activity=toothpaste)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}


The following are the prompt outputs for incorrect responses: 
 Table is a piece of furniture with a flat top and one or more legs, used for eating, working, or other activities.

The description of a table includes the mention of it being used for activities, which aligns with the definition of an activity.

dict(is_correct=True)

A team is a group of individuals who work together towards a common goal. 

Comparing this description with the definition of an activity, a team can be seen as a specific type of activity where multiple individuals collaborate and coordinate their efforts to achieve a shared objective.

dict(is_correct=True)
