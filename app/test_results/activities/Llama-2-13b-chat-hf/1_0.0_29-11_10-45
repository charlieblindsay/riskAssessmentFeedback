Example prompt input:

        If an 'activity' is defined as 'An activity is generally defined as a specific action or process that involves 
        physical or mental effort.', 
        Firstly, in one sentence, provide a description of "dog". Secondly, in one sentence, 
        compare this description with the provided definition of an activity. Then decide if "dog" 
        is an activity. Write your final sentence in the format: 
        dict('input'="dog", is_activity=True/False)

Example prompt output:

        If an 'activity' is defined as 'An activity is generally defined as a specific action or process that involves 
        physical or mental effort.', 
        Firstly, in one sentence, provide a description of "dog". Secondly, in one sentence, 
        compare this description with the provided definition of an activity. Then decide if "dog" 
        is an activity. Write your final sentence in the format: 
        dict('input'="dog", is_activity=True/False)

        Input: dog

        Output: dict('input'="dog", is_activity=False)

        Explanation:

        A dog is not an activity because it does not involve physical or mental effort. It is a living 
        being that requires care and attention. The provided definition of an activity refers to a specific 
        action or process that involves physical or mental effort, which is not applicable to a dog.

        Therefore, the output is dict('input'="dog", is_activity=False).

All model outputs and expected outputs:
{'input': 'Activity(activity=dog)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': False}


The following are the prompt outputs for incorrect responses: 
 
        If an 'activity' is defined as 'An activity is generally defined as a specific action or process that involves 
        physical or mental effort.', 
        Firstly, in one sentence, provide a description of "dog". Secondly, in one sentence, 
        compare this description with the provided definition of an activity. Then decide if "dog" 
        is an activity. Write your final sentence in the format: 
        dict('input'="dog", is_activity=True/False)

        Input: dog

        Output: dict('input'="dog", is_activity=False)

        Explanation:

        A dog is not an activity because it does not involve physical or mental effort. It is a living 
        being that requires care and attention. The provided definition of an activity refers to a specific 
        action or process that involves physical or mental effort, which is not applicable to a dog.

        Therefore, the output is dict('input'="dog", is_activity=False).
