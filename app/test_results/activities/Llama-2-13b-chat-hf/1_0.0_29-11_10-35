Example prompt input:

        If an 'activity' is defined as 'An activity is generally defined as a specific action or process that involves 
        physical or mental effort.', 
        Firstly, in one sentence, provide a description of "dog". Secondly, in one sentence, 
        compare this description with the provided definition of an activity. Then if "dog" 
        is an activity, is_correct = True. Write your final sentence in the format: 
        dict('input'="dog", is_correct=True/False)
