Example prompt input:

        If an 'activity' is defined as 'An activity is generally defined as a specific action or process that involves 
        physical or mental effort.', 
        First provide a description of "dog". Then compare this description 
        with the provided definition of an activity. Then if "dog" is an activity, is_correct = True. 
        End your answer in the format: dict('input': "dog", is_an_activity: True/False)
