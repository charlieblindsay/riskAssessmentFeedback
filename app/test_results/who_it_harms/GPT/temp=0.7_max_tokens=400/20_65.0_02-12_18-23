Example prompt input:
In one sentence, describe the hazard: 'Potential vehicle collision or sudden stop' during the 
        activity: 'Driving without Seatbelt' and how it harms: Increased risk of severe injury or fatality in the event of an accident. Then in one sentence,
        explain whether or not 'who it harms': 'Driver and passengers in the vehicle' is harmed by this hazard. 
        If 'who it harms' is harmed by this hazard, is_correct = True. 
        Then write the final sentence of your answer in the format: dict(is_correct=True/False).

Example prompt output:
'Potential vehicle collision or sudden stop' during the activity of 'Driving without Seatbelt' increases the risk of severe injury or fatality in the event of an accident. 

Driver and passengers in the vehicle are harmed by this hazard, therefore is_correct = True. 

dict(is_correct=True)

The following are the prompt outputs for incorrect responses: 
 {'is_correct': True}

{'is_correct': True}

Impaired judgment and coordination during excessive alcohol consumption increases the risk of accidents and health issues. 

Office workers or anyone using the workstation can be harmed by this hazard, therefore is_correct = True. 

dict(is_correct=True)

Musculoskeletal strain during poor ergonomics in office setup can lead to the development of chronic pain and discomfort, which harms individuals, businesses, and organizations. 

dict(is_correct=True)

Individuals who skip regular exercise and engage in physical inactivity face an increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health issues, which harm their overall well-being.

Dict(is_correct=True)

'UV radiation' during the activity 'Not Using Sunscreen' increases the risk of skin cancer and premature aging by damaging the skin cells. 
'The environment and future generations' are harmed by this hazard as UV radiation can also harm marine life, crops, and contribute to climate change, leading to long-term negative effects. 
{'is_correct': True}
