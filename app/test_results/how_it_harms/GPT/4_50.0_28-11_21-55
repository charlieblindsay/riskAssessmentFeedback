Example prompt input:
In one sentence, describe the hazard: 'Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear' during the 
        activity: 'Chemical handling'. Then in one sentence, determine whether or not 
        'Chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems' is a way that this hazard causes harm. 
        If it does cause harm, is_correct = True. Then write the final sentence of your answer 
        in the format: dict(is_correct=True/False).

Example prompt output:
Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear during chemical handling can lead to chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems, which is correct and dict(is_correct=True).

All model outputs and expected outputs:
{'input': 'HowItHarms(how_it_harms=Chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems, activity=Chemical handling, hazard=Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': True}
{'input': 'HowItHarms(how_it_harms=Fires, causing burns, property damage, and potential loss of life, activity=Fire safety demonstration, hazard=Presence of combustible materials near an open flame)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': True}
{'input': 'HowItHarms(how_it_harms=Fires, causing burns, property damage, and potential loss of life, activity=Chemical handling, hazard=Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'HowItHarms(how_it_harms=Chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems, activity=Fire safety demonstration, hazard=Presence of combustible materials near an open flame)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': False}


The following are the prompt outputs for incorrect responses: 
 The hazard of handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear during the activity of chemical handling can cause harm by causing fires, which can result in burns, property damage, and potential loss of life. 

{'is_correct': True}

The hazard is the presence of combustible materials near an open flame during the fire safety demonstration. 
Chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems are ways that this hazard causes harm, so is_correct = True. 
{'is_correct': True}
