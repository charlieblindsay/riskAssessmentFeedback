Example prompt input:
In one sentence, describe the hazard: 'Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear' during the 
        activity: 'Chemical handling'. Then in one sentence, determine whether or not 
        'Chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems' is a way that this hazard causes harm in this activity. 
        If it does cause harm, is_correct = True. Then write the final sentence of your answer 
        in the format: dict(is_correct=True/False).

Example prompt output:
Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear during chemical handling can lead to chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems. 
The statement "Chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems" is a way that this hazard causes harm in this activity, so is_correct = True. 
{'is_correct': True}

All model outputs and expected outputs:
{'input': 'HowItHarms(how_it_harms=Chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems, activity=Chemical handling, hazard=Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': True}
{'input': 'HowItHarms(how_it_harms=Fires, causing burns, property damage, and potential loss of life, activity=Fire safety demonstration, hazard=Presence of combustible materials near an open flame)', 'is_correct': None, 'expected_output': True}
{'input': 'HowItHarms(how_it_harms=Fires, causing burns, property damage, and potential loss of life, activity=Chemical handling, hazard=Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'HowItHarms(how_it_harms=Chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems, activity=Fire safety demonstration, hazard=Presence of combustible materials near an open flame)', 'is_correct': None, 'expected_output': False}


The following are the prompt outputs for incorrect responses: 
 The hazard of 'Presence of combustible materials near an open flame' during the activity 'Fire safety demonstration' can cause harm by potentially causing fires, resulting in burns, property damage, and potential loss of life, therefore is_correct = True. 

{
  "is_correct": true
}

The hazard of 'Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear' during the activity of 'Chemical handling' can lead to chemical burns and other injuries. 

The harm caused by this hazard, including fires, burns, property damage, and potential loss of life, is correct. 

{'is_correct': True}

The hazard of 'Presence of combustible materials near an open flame' during the activity 'Fire safety demonstration' can cause harm by potentially igniting the combustible materials and leading to chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems, therefore is_correct = True. 

{
  "is_correct": true
}
