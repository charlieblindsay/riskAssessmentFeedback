Example prompt input:
In one sentence, describe the hazard: 'Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear' during the 
        activity: 'Chemical handling'. Then in one sentence, determine whether or not 
        'Chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems' is a way that this hazard causes harm. 
        If it does cause harm, is_correct = True. Then write the final sentence of your answer 
        in the format: dict(is_correct=True/False).

Example prompt output:
Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear during the activity of chemical handling can lead to chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems. 

dict(is_correct=True)

All model outputs and expected outputs:
{'input': 'HowItHarms(how_it_harms=Chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems, activity=Chemical handling, hazard=Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear)', 'is_correct': True, 'expected_output': True}
{'input': 'HowItHarms(how_it_harms=Fires, causing burns, property damage, and potential loss of life, activity=Fire safety demonstration, hazard=Presence of combustible materials near an open flame)', 'is_correct': None, 'expected_output': True}
{'input': 'HowItHarms(how_it_harms=Fires, causing burns, property damage, and potential loss of life, activity=Chemical handling, hazard=Handling corrosive chemicals without protective gear)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}
{'input': 'HowItHarms(how_it_harms=Chemical burns, respiratory issues, and health problems, activity=Fire safety demonstration, hazard=Presence of combustible materials near an open flame)', 'is_correct': False, 'expected_output': False}


The following are the prompt outputs for incorrect responses: 
 The hazard is the presence of combustible materials near an open flame during the fire safety demonstration. 
Fires, causing burns, property damage, and potential loss of life is a way that this hazard causes harm, so is_correct = True. 

{
  "is_correct": true
}
