# riskAssessment
*Brief description of what this evaluation function does, from the developer perspective*
This evaluation function is used to provide feedback to students on their risk assessment inputs. 
The response input for the evaluation function is 12 risk assessment inputs, 6 of which are text inputs (activity, hazard, how it harms, who it harms, prevention and mitigation) and 6 of which are number inputs used to fill out a risk matrix (uncontrolled likelihood, uncontrolled severity, uncontrolled risk, controlled likelihood, controlled severity, controlled risk).
The evaluation function checks that the risk matrix inputs follow
