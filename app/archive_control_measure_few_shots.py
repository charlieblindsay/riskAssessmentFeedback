        # 1. In one sentence, describe the hazard event: "Ink spillage on students face" during the
        # activity: 'Fluids laboratory' given the harm caused: "Serious eye damage" for Students.
        # 2. Thinking step by step, explain whether or not 'Cleaning the eyes out with water' reduces the likelihood that hazard event: "Ink spillage on students face" occurs.
        # If so, it is a prevention measure.

        # <EXAMPLE OUTPUT>
        # Hazard Event Description: The hazard event of 'Ink spillage on student's face' during the activity 'Fluids laboratory' can lead to serious eye damage to students.
        # Prevention Explanation: 'Cleaning the eyes out with water' is a reactive measure applied after the hazard event of 'Ink spillage on student's face'; it therefore does not reduce the likelihood of the hazard event and is not a prevention measure.
        # Mitigation Explanation: If ink has been spilled onto a student's face, 'Cleaning the eyes out with water' will help to wash the ink out of the eyes and reduce eye damage after the hazard event has occurred; as it reduces the harm caused by the hazard event, it is therefore a mitigation measure.
        # Answer: Mitigation.

        # Hazard Event Description: The hazard event of 'Water being spilt on the floor causing students to slip' during the activity 'Fluids laboratory' can lead to impact injuries.
        # Prevention Explanation: 'Keeping the water tank stationary when it's full' means water cannot be spilled on to the floor by moving the water tank; no water on the floor reduces the likelihood of the hazard event of a student slipping; since it reduces the likelihood of the hazard event, it is a prevention measure.
        # Mitigation Explanation: If water has been spilled on the floor, 'not moving the water tank when it is full' does not remove or reduce the harm caused by the hazard event, as the water is already spilled to pose a slipping hazard; as it does not reduce the harm caused by the hazard event, it is not a mitigation measure.
        # Answer: Prevention.

        # <EXAMPLE OUTPUT>
        # Hazard Event Description: A cyclist commuting to work gets hit by a car, resulting in a head injury.
        # Prevention Explanation: Thinking step by step:
        # - Wearing a helmet does not directly influence the likelihood of a cyclist getting hit by a car.
        # - A helmet does not change the behavior of the cyclist or the driver of the car.
        # - The presence or absence of a helmet does not affect the probability of the collision occurring. Therefore, wearing a helmet does not reduce the likelihood of the hazard event "Cyclist gets hit by car" from occurring. It is not a prevention measure.
        # Mitigation Explanation: Thinking step by step:
        # - In the event of a collision, a helmet can absorb some of the impact energy and protect the cyclist's head.
        # - By reducing the direct impact to the head, a helmet can lessen the severity of a head injury.
        # - While a helmet may not completely eliminate the risk of a head injury, it can significantly reduce the extent of the harm caused. Therefore, wearing a helmet reduces the harm caused by the "Head injury" for the cyclist. It is a mitigation measure.
        # Answer: Mitigation

        # If so, it is a prevention measure.
        # 3. Thinking step by step, explain whether or not 'Keeping hand around zip tie when cutting to stop it from flying' removes or reduces the harm caused: "Impact injury" for the 'Students'.

        # Hazard Event Description: The hazard event of 'Cut Zip tie flies and hits audience member' during the activity 'Using a spring contraption as a demonstration for a TPS presentation' can lead to impact injuries.
        # Prevention Explanation: 'Keeping hand around zip tie when cutting to stop it from flying' will stop the zip tie from flying and therefore stop the hazard event from occurring. Therefore, the likelihood of the hazard event occurring has been reduced to zero; since the likelihood of the hazard event has been reduced, it is therefore a prevention measure.
        # Mitigation Explanation: If the hazard event occurs and the zip tie flies and hits an audience member, 'keeping hand around zip tie when cutting to stop it from flying' does not remove or reduce the impact injury caused by the hazard, as the zip tie has already flown and caused harm; it is therefore not a mitigation measure.
        # Answer: Prevention.
