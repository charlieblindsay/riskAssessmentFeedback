        Hazard Event Description: The hazard event of 'Ink spillage on student's face' during the activity 'Fluids laboratory' can lead to serious eye damage to students.
        Prevention Explanation: 'First aid' is a reactive measure applied after the hazard event of 'Ink spillage on student's face'; it therefore does not reduce the likelihood of the hazard event and is not a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If ink has been spilled onto a student's face, 'first aid' will help to wash the ink out of the eyes and reduce eye damage after the hazard event has occurred; as it reduces the harm caused by the hazard event, it is therefore a mitigation measure.

        Hazard Event Description: The hazard event of 'Water being spilt on the floor causing students to slip' during the activity 'Fluids laboratory' can lead to impact injuries.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Keeping the water tank stationary when it's full' means water cannot be spilled on to the floor by moving the water tank; no water on the floor reduces the likelihood of the hazard event of a student slipping; since it reduces the likelihood of the hazard event, it is a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If water has been spilled on the floor, 'not moving the water tank when it is full' does not remove or reduce the harm caused by the hazard event, as the water is already spilled to pose a slipping hazard; as it does not reduce the harm caused by the hazard event, it is not a mitigation measure.

        If so, it is a mitigation measure.
        4. If it is a prevention measure, answer 'Prevention'. If it is a migitation meausure, answer 'Mitigation'.
        If it is neither a prevention measure nor a mitigation measure, answer 'Neither'. If it is both a
        prevention measure and a mitigation measure, answer 'Both'.
        </EXAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS>

        <EXAMPLE OUTPUT>
        Hazard Event Description: The hazard event of 'Cut Zip tie flies and hits audience member' during the activity 'Using a spring contraption as a demonstration for a TPS presentation' can lead to impact injuries.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Keeping hand around zip tie when cutting to stop it from flying' will stop the zip tie from flying and therefore stop the hazard event from occurring. Therefore, the likelihood of the hazard event occurring has been reduced to zero; since the likelihood of the hazard event has been reduced, it is therefore a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If the hazard event occurs and the zip tie flies and hits an audience member, 'keeping hand around zip tie when cutting to stop it from flying' does not remove or reduce the impact injury caused by the hazard, as the zip tie has already flown and caused harm; it is therefore not a mitigation measure.
        Answer: Prevention.

        Hazard event Description. An outbreak of foot and mouth disease in livestock farming operations can lead to significant economic losses in the agriculture sector due to the highly contagious nature of the virus among livestock.
        Future Harm Explanation: Assuming that there has been an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, a rapid response can limit the spread of the disease and minimize the overall economic impact on the livestock farming industry. Hence, rapid response to detect and contain outbreaks of foot and mouth disease can significantly reduce the future harm caused by the hazard event.

        <EXAMPLE OUTPUT>
        Hazard event description: A pandemic spreading through the population during public health and emergency response activities, causing loss of life in the general population.
        Future Harm Explanation: Assuming a pandemic is spreading through the population, contact tracing involves identifying and isolating infected individuals and their close contacts; these measures limit further transmission of the disease, slowing its spread and ultimately reducing the loss of life. Hence, contact tracing and quarantine measures can help reduce the future harm caused by a pandemic spreading through the population.

        <EXAMPLE OUTPUT>
        Hazard event description: Cyclist getting hit by a car while riding a bike, resulting in impact injury to the cyclist.
        Future Harm Explanation: Assuming the cyclist is hit by the car, high vis clothing does not provide any protection or lessen the injuries sustained from the impact with the vehicle. Hence, wearing high visibility clothing does not reduce the harm caused to the cyclist if they are hit by a car.
