        Hazard Description: During a fluids laboratory, ink spillage on a student's face causes serious eye damage.

        Prevention Explanation: Thinking step by step:
        - Cleaning the eyes out with water is a response measure taken after the ink spillage has already occurred.
        - The act of cleaning the eyes with water does therefore not reduce the likelihood of the hazard event.
        - It is therefore not a prevention measure.

        Mitigation Explanation: Thinking step by step:
        - If ink spills on a student's face and gets into their eyes, immediately cleaning the eyes out with water can help flush out the ink.
        - Removing the ink from the eyes quickly can reduce the exposure time and minimize the potential for serious eye damage.
        - While cleaning the eyes with water may not completely eliminate the risk of eye damage, it can significantly reduce the severity of the harm caused.
        - It is therefore a mitigation measure.

        Hazard Description: During a fluids laboratory, water spills on the floor, causing students to slip and suffer injuries
        Hazard Event: Student slips on water
        Harm Caused: Injury caused by students slipping

        Prevention Explanation: Thinking step by step:
        - Keeping the water tank stationary when it's full prevents it from being accidentally knocked over or moved, which could cause water to spill.
        - Therefore, keeping the water tank stationary reduces the likelihood of water spilling onto the floor is significantly reduced.
        - Reducing the chances of water spillage reduces the likelihood of students slipping on the wet floor.
        - Therefore, keeping the water tank stationary when it's full reduces the likelihood of the hazard event from occurring. It is a prevention measure.

        Mitigation Explanation: Thinking step by step:
        - Keeping the water tank stationary when it's full does not directly reduce the harm caused to students if they do slip on spilled water.
        - The severity of the injuries sustained from slipping on a wet floor is not mitigated by the tank's stationary position.
        - Therefore, keeping the water tank stationary when it's full does not remove or reduce the harm caused by "Injury caused by students slipping" for the students. It is not a mitigation measure.

        <EXAMPLE OUTPUT>
        Hazard Description: A cyclist commuting to work gets hit by a car, resulting in a head injury.
        Hazard Event: Car crashes into the cyclist
        Harm Caused: Head injury

        Prevention Explanation: Thinking step by step:
        - Wearing a helmet does not directly influence the likelihood of a cyclist getting hit by a car.
        - A helmet does not change the behavior of the cyclist or the driver of the car.
        - The presence or absence of a helmet does not affect the probability of the collision occurring. Therefore, wearing a helmet does not reduce the likelihood of the hazard event from occurring. It is not a prevention measure.
        
        Mitigation Explanation: Thinking step by step:
        - In the event of a collision, a helmet can absorb some of the impact energy and protect the cyclist's head.
        - By reducing the direct impact to the head, a helmet can lessen the severity of a head injury.
        - While a helmet may not completely eliminate the risk of a head injury, it can significantly reduce the extent of the harm caused. Therefore, wearing a helmet reduces the harm caused by the "Head injury" for the cyclist. It is a mitigation measure.

        Hazard Description: During a fluids laboratory, a cut zip tie flies and hits a student audience member, causing an impact injury.
        Hazard Event: Zip tie projectile hits audience member
        Harm Caused: Impact injury

        Prevention Explanation: Thinking step by step:
        - Keeping a hand around the zip tie while cutting it can physically prevent the cut piece from flying away.
        - By containing the cut zip tie, the likelihood of it being launched towards the audience is greatly reduced.
        - Therefore, keeping a hand around the zip tie when cutting it reduces the likelihood of the hazard event from occurring. It is a prevention measure.
        
        Mitigation Explanation: Thinking step by step:
        - If a cut zip tie were to fly and hit a student, keeping a hand around it during cutting would not reduce the impact force.
        - The hand around the zip tie does not provide any protective barrier for the student who might be hit.
        - Therefore, keeping a hand around the zip tie when cutting does not remove or reduce the harm caused by the "Impact injury" for the students. It is not a mitigation measure.
