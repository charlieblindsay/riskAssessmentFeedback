        Hazard Description: The hazard of 'Water being spilt on the floor' during the activity 'Fluids laboratory' can lead to injuries caused by possible slipping on a wet floor to students.
        Hazard Event Description: Water is accidentally spilled on the floor.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Keeping the water tank stationary when it's full' reduces the likelihood of spilling water as moving it increases the likelihood of water being spilled; as it reduces the likelihood of the hazard event, it is a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If water has been spilled on the floor, 'not moving the water tank when it is full' does not remove or reduce the harm caused by the hazard event, as the water is already spilled and poses a slipping hazard; as it does not reduce the harm caused by the hazard event, it is not a mitigation measure.

        Hazard Description: The hazard of 'Loud noise' during the activity 'Using a trombone as a demonstration for a TPS presentation' can cause hearing damage to everyone present.
        Hazard Event Description: The trombone player plays the instrument at a high volume, producing a loud noise.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Keeping a space between the player and the audience' does not reduce the likelihood of the trombone producing a loud noise. As it does not reduce the likelihood of the hazard event, it is not a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If the hazard event occurs and the trombone produces a loud noise, 'keeping a space between the player and the audience' will reduce the noise heard by the audience, hence reducing the severity of the hearing damage caused by the loud noise; as it reduces the harm caused by the hazard event, it is a mitigation measure.

        Hazard Event Description: A sharp syringe needle is directed towards an student.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Wearing a lab coat and personal protective equipment (PPE)' does not reduce the likelihood of a student directing a syringe needle towards another student; as it does not reduce the likelihood of the hazard event, it is therefore not a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If a sharp syringe needle is directed towards a student, 'wearing a lab coat and PPE' will reduce the harm caused by the sharp needle as it is unlikely to pierce through the lab coat and PPE; as it reduces the harm caused by the hazard event, it is a mitigation measure.
